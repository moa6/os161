Augustine's Contributions:

Assignment 4

Mohammed and I started off working on the assignment together,
initially discussing how to implement the file table.  However, Mohammed got very ill so I
stepped up to finish the assignment.  I coded the file table and implemented all
of the sytem calls.

Assignment 5

1) Worked together with Mohammed to come up with the code needed to assign PIDs
to user processes

2) Worked together with Mohammed  to implement sys_fork

3) Implemented sys_waitpid and sys__exit

4) Modified Mohammed's initial implementation of sys_execv so that it can pass
badcall and bigexec

5) Fixed memory leaks, cleaned up the code, and ensured code was properly
commented

Assignment 6

Designed and implemented the coremap, page table, the synchronization protocols
to facilitate swapping, and tlbshootdown.

Mohammad's Contributions:

Assignment 4

Started off assignment with Augustine and answered the coding questions. But
fell sick and we used Augustine code for submission to meet initial assignment
deadline. However, I did code my own file table and most of the syscall during
reading break (code in my local repo not in bitbucket)


Assignment 5

1) Worked together with Augustine to come up with the code needed to assign PIDs
to user processes

3) Augustine implemented sys_waitpid and sys__exit
